# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide

Guidelines for running the CTI Takedown Tool in production environments.

## Environments
Use a staging environment for tests before promoting to production. Ensure separate configuration files per environment.

## Deployment Strategies
- Binary deployment on servers
- Containerized deployment with Docker

## High Availability
Run multiple instances behind a load balancer and use a shared database/queue if required.

## Monitoring
Integrate with your monitoring stack to track health checks, logs and metrics.

## Backup and Recovery
Back up configuration files and state databases regularly.

## Maintenance & Security
Apply updates, rotate credentials and harden network access. See the [Portuguese version](../../docs_pt-BR/deployment/README.md) for detailed procedures.
